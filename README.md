## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process
### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties and utility classes
- CSS Grid, Flexbox
- VanillaJS

### What I learned

:arrow_right: In this project I learned a lot of things. I had an opportunity to learn new aria-attributes, how to build 'Skip to content' button, `@supports` feature.
:arrow_right: The hardest part was to combine all of the utility classes and not to break the things. The positioning was also challenging. 

### Continued development

:fast_forward: I think that this project can be improved by
  - using json file for updating the content instead of swapping the `hidden` attribute of the articles
  - fixing numbers right next to the text in primary navigation tabs (currently it is located above text)
  - `picture` elements that contain article images can be used for 'art direction' problem if the design specs change and we have to update images based on the orientation of the device
